# animate mode - build one web animation

Shared rules (frequency gate, purpose, easing and duration tables, springs, physicality, interruptibility, performance, accessibility, the never-ship table, the Before / After review format) live in SKILL.md section 2 and 3. This file adds only what is specific to this mode. Pull exact values from SKILL.md, never approximate.

Sequence: gate (SKILL.md 2.1) -> purpose (2.2) -> tool -> properties -> easing / duration or spring (2.3-2.5) -> interruption and exit (2.7) -> reduced motion and hover gating (2.9). Steps 1 and 2 gate everything.

### Operating Posture

You are a senior design engineer building the animation yourself. The bar is Emil Kowalski's animation philosophy — the same bar `/emil review` enforces. Write it so it passes that review the first time.

Two failure modes, and the first is worse:

1. **Animating something that shouldn't animate.** The gate below exists to produce zero lines of code sometimes. That's a success, not a dodge.
2. **Animating the right thing with the wrong ingredients** — `ease-in` on an entrance, `scale(0)`, keyframes on a toast, a duration that makes a dropdown feel sluggish.

Never present motion options as a menu. Make the call, state the reasoning in one line, write the code.

### Hard Rules

1. **Run the sequence in order.** Steps 1 and 2 gate everything. Don't reach for a curve before you know whether it animates at all.
2. **No approximated values.** Every curve, duration, and spring config comes from the tables below. Never invent `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` because it looks familiar.
3. **Extend the codebase's tokens, don't fork them.** If `--ease-out` or a duration scale already exists, use it. Adding a parallel system is a defect.
4. **Reduced motion and hover gating ship with the animation**, not as a follow-up.
5. **Cheapest tool that works.** Don't install a motion library for a fade.

### The Build Sequence

Steps 1 (gate), 2 (purpose), 5 (easing / duration / spring) and 7 (reduced motion, hover gating) are SKILL.md 2.1, 2.2, 2.3-2.5 and 2.9. The never-ship table is SKILL.md 2.11.

#### 3. Pick the tool — cheapest that works

Walk down; stop at the first that fits.

| Need | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Hover, press, color, a state toggle you control with a class or attribute | **CSS transition** |
| Entry animation on mount, no JS state | **CSS `@starting-style`** |
| Predetermined motion that must stay smooth while the page is busy loading | **CSS animation** (runs off the main thread) |
| Programmatic control with CSS performance, no library | **WAAPI** (`element.animate()`) |
| Springs, layout animations, exit animations, gesture-driven values | **Motion** (`motion.dev`) |

CSS animations beat JS under load — they run off the main thread, while `requestAnimationFrame`-based animation drops frames while the browser loads, scripts, or paints. Use CSS for predetermined motion, JS for dynamic and interruptible motion.

If the task needs a *component* rather than an animation — a toast, a drawer, a command menu, a dropdown — stop and switch to `/emil pick`. Hand-rolling those is how you end up with a `<div>` dropdown and no focus management.

#### 4. Pick the properties

- **`transform` and `opacity` only.** They skip layout and paint and run on the GPU. `width`/`height`/`margin`/`padding`/`top`/`left` trigger all three. (`clip-path` is the sanctioned fourth — see RECIPES.md. `height` is tolerated only for accordions, where there's no transform equivalent.)
- **Never `scale(0)`.** Start from `scale(0.9–0.97)` + `opacity: 0`. Nothing in the real world appears from nothing.
- **`transform-origin` at the trigger** for popovers, dropdowns, menus, tooltips — `var(--transform-origin)` in Base UI. **Modals are exempt**; they're not anchored to a trigger, so they stay centered.
- **Percentages in `translate()`** are relative to the element's own size — `translateY(100%)` moves by its own height whatever the content. Prefer over hardcoded pixels.
- **In Motion, use the full transform string.** `x`/`y`/`scale` shorthands are not hardware-accelerated and drop frames under load:

```jsx
<motion.div animate={{ x: 100 }} />                          // drops frames under load
<motion.div animate={{ transform: "translateX(100px)" }} />  // hardware accelerated
```

- **Never drive a child's transform from a CSS variable on the parent** — it recalculates styles for every child. Set `transform` on the element directly.

#### 6. Interruption and exit

- **Transitions, not keyframes, for anything triggered rapidly** — toasts, toggles, anything a user can fire twice in a second. Transitions retarget from the current value; keyframes restart from zero.
- **Springs for gestures**, because they carry velocity through an interruption.
- **Exit the way it entered.** A toast that slides in from the bottom leaves through the bottom. Symmetric paths are what make swipe-to-dismiss feel obvious.
- **Asymmetric timing where the user is deciding.** Slow on the deliberate phase (a hold-to-confirm press: 2s linear), snappy on the system response (release: 200ms ease-out).

### Recipes

For ready-to-build implementations of the common cases — button press, dropdown, tooltip, modal, drawer, toast, accordion, stagger, hold-to-confirm, tab indicator, scroll reveal, drag-to-dismiss — see [RECIPES.md](RECIPES.md). Load it whenever the request matches one of those components; start from the recipe rather than from a blank file.

### Output

Write the code. Then, in at most a few lines:

- **The gate result** — frequency tier and the named purpose. If something in the request was rejected, say which and why.
- **The ingredients** — tool, properties, curve, duration or spring config, in one line each.
- **What to feel-check** — if the result depends on feel you can't judge from code (a crossfade, a spring's bounce, the opacity/height balance in an entering list), say so and point at the check: play it at 2–5× duration or in the DevTools animation inspector, step it frame by frame, test gestures on a real device, and look again the next day with fresh eyes.

Don't pad this into a report. The code is the deliverable.

### Tone

Opinionated and brief. When the honest answer is "this shouldn't animate," give it — that answer is the reason this skill exists. When feel genuinely can't be settled from code, say so instead of guessing at a value.

---

# Recipes

Ready-to-build implementations for the cases that come up most. Start from the recipe, then adapt — don't rebuild from scratch.

Curves are the `--ease-out`, `--ease-in-out`, and `--ease-drawer` tokens defined in SKILL.md.

---

### Button press

Any pressable element. Instant feedback that the interface heard the user.

```css
.button {
  transition: transform 160ms var(--ease-out);
}

.button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
}
```

`scale()` scales children too — the label and icons come along, which is what makes it read as a physical press.

No hover gating needed here: `:active` is a real press on touch. Gate any `:hover` styling separately.

---

### Dropdown, popover, menu, select

Scales out of its trigger, not out of thin air.

```css
.popover {
  transform-origin: var(--transform-origin); /* Base UI supplies this */
  transition:
    opacity 200ms var(--ease-out),
    transform 200ms var(--ease-out);
}

.popover[data-starting-style],
.popover[data-ending-style] {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: scale(0.95);
}
```

The `transform-origin` is the whole point — the panel should look like it came out of the thing you clicked.

---

### Tooltip

Same shape as a popover, faster, plus the detail most implementations miss.

```css
.tooltip {
  transform-origin: var(--transform-origin);
  transition:
    transform 125ms var(--ease-out),
    opacity 125ms var(--ease-out);
}

.tooltip[data-starting-style],
.tooltip[data-ending-style] {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: scale(0.97);
}

/* Once one tooltip is open, neighbours open instantly */
.tooltip[data-instant] {
  transition-duration: 0ms;
}
```

The initial delay prevents accidental activation. After that, skipping both the delay and the animation makes the whole toolbar feel faster.

---

### Modal

The one popover that stays centered.

```css
.modal {
  transform-origin: center; /* exempt — not anchored to a trigger */
  transition:
    opacity 250ms var(--ease-out),
    transform 250ms var(--ease-out);
}

.modal[data-starting-style],
.modal[data-ending-style] {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: scale(0.96);
}

.backdrop {
  transition: opacity 250ms var(--ease-out);
}
```

Animate the backdrop's opacity alongside it so they read as one surface.

---

### Drawer / sheet

```css
.drawer {
  transform: translateY(0);
  transition: transform 500ms var(--ease-drawer);
}

.drawer[data-closed] {
  transform: translateY(100%);
}
```

This is how Vaul hides a drawer before animating it in.

Add drag and it becomes a gesture problem — see **Drag to dismiss** below.

---

### Toast

```css
.toast {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
  transition:
    opacity 400ms ease,
    transform 400ms ease;

  @starting-style {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(100%);
  }
}
```

- `ease` rather than `ease-out`, slightly slower than typical UI: Sonner reads as elegant partly because its motion is tuned to the component's personality rather than to the generic UI budget.
- If `@starting-style` isn't available, fall back to the mount flag:

```jsx
useEffect(() => { setMounted(true); }, []);
// <div data-mounted={mounted}>
```

When toasts stack and the list reflows, the opacity change has to work against the height change. There's no formula for that pair — adjust until it feels right, then check it again the next day.

---

### Accordion / collapse

```css
.content {
  overflow: hidden;
  transition:
    height 200ms var(--ease-out),
    opacity 200ms var(--ease-out);
}
```

Keep it short — this is one of the few animations that costs layout on every frame, so a long duration is expensive as well as sluggish. Measure the content height in JS (or use a headless primitive that supplies it) rather than animating to `auto`.

---

### Stagger a group entrance

For a list or grid the user sees occasionally — not for a list they scroll past all day.

```css
.item {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(8px);
  animation: fadeIn 300ms var(--ease-out) forwards;
}

.item:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 50ms; }
.item:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 100ms; }
.item:nth-child(4) { animation-delay: 150ms; }

@keyframes fadeIn {
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

Stagger is decorative — it must never block interaction while it plays.

---

### Hold to confirm

For destructive actions where a plain click is too easy to fire by accident.

```css
.overlay {
  clip-path: inset(0 100% 0 0);
  transition: clip-path 200ms var(--ease-out); /* release: snappy */
}

.button:active .overlay {
  clip-path: inset(0 0 0 0);
  transition: clip-path 2s linear;             /* press: slow and deliberate */
}

.button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
}
```

`linear` is correct here — the fill is a progress indicator, and progress shouldn't ease.

---

### Tab indicator with a color transition

Timing individual color transitions across a tab list never quite lands. Clip instead.

Duplicate the tab list. Style the copy as the active state — different background, different text color. Clip the copy so only the active tab shows, and animate the clip on change:

```css
.tabs-active-copy {
  clip-path: inset(0 60% 0 20%); /* driven by the active tab's position */
  transition: clip-path 250ms var(--ease-in-out);
}
```

The text and background change together, in perfect sync, because they're one element being revealed rather than two colors being interpolated.

---

### Scroll reveal

Marketing surfaces only. Don't do this to functional UI a user visits daily.

```css
.reveal {
  clip-path: inset(0 0 100% 0);
  transition: clip-path 600ms var(--ease-in-out);
}

.reveal[data-visible] {
  clip-path: inset(0 0 0 0);
}
```

Trigger with `IntersectionObserver`, or Motion's `useInView` with `{ once: true, margin: "-100px" }`. Fire it once — re-animating on every scroll-by is an interface fighting its reader.

---

### Drag to dismiss

The gesture recipe. Springs, not durations, because the user can reverse mid-motion.

```js
// Dismiss on a flick, not just on distance
const timeTaken = Date.now() - dragStartTime.current;
const velocity = Math.abs(swipeAmount) / timeTaken;

if (Math.abs(swipeAmount) >= SWIPE_THRESHOLD || velocity > 0.11) {
  dismiss();
}
```

```js
// Set transform on the dragged element directly.
// Driving it through a CSS variable on the parent recalcs styles for every child.
element.style.transform = `translateY(${distance}px)`;
```

Four details that separate a good drag from a bad one:

- **Pointer capture** once the drag starts, so it continues when the pointer leaves the element's bounds.
- **Multi-touch protection** — `if (isDragging) return` on new touch points, or switching fingers mid-drag makes the element jump.
- **Damping past boundaries** — dragging beyond a natural edge moves the element less the further it goes. Real things slow before they stop.
- **Friction, not a wall** — allow the over-drag with rising resistance rather than refusing it.

Settle with a spring so an interrupted drag keeps its velocity:

```js
{ type: "spring", duration: 0.5, bounce: 0.2 }
```

---

### Masking a crossfade that won't settle

When two states overlap visibly during a transition and no amount of easing or duration tuning fixes it, blur the seam:

```css
.content {
  transition:
    filter 200ms ease,
    opacity 200ms ease;
}

.content.transitioning {
  filter: blur(2px);
  opacity: 0.7;
}
```

Without blur the eye reads two distinct objects swapping. Blur blends them into one perceived transformation. Keep it under 20px — heavy blur is expensive, especially in Safari.

---

### Programmatic, without a library

When the motion needs JS control but not a dependency, WAAPI gives you CSS-grade performance:

```js
element.animate(
  [{ clipPath: 'inset(0 0 100% 0)' }, { clipPath: 'inset(0 0 0 0)' }],
  { duration: 1000, fill: 'forwards', easing: 'cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1)' }
);
```

Hardware-accelerated, interruptible, no bundle cost.

# Techniques

### CSS Transform Mastery

#### translateY with percentages

Percentage values in `translate()` are relative to the element's own size. Use `translateY(100%)` to move an element by its own height, regardless of actual dimensions. This is how Sonner positions toasts and how Vaul hides the drawer before animating in.

```css
/* Works regardless of drawer height */
.drawer-hidden {
  transform: translateY(100%);
}

/* Works regardless of toast height */
.toast-enter {
  transform: translateY(-100%);
}
```

Prefer percentages over hardcoded pixel values. They are less error-prone and adapt to content.

#### scale() scales children too

Unlike `width`/`height`, `scale()` also scales an element's children. When scaling a button on press, the font size, icons, and content scale proportionally. This is a feature, not a bug.

#### 3D transforms for depth

`rotateX()`, `rotateY()` with `transform-style: preserve-3d` create real 3D effects in CSS. Orbiting animations, coin flips, and depth effects are all possible without JavaScript.

```css
.wrapper {
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
}

@keyframes orbit {
  from {
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%) rotateY(0deg) translateZ(72px) rotateY(360deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%) rotateY(360deg) translateZ(72px) rotateY(0deg);
  }
}
```

#### transform-origin

Every element has an anchor point from which transforms execute. The default is center. Set it to match where the trigger lives for origin-aware interactions.

### clip-path for Animation

`clip-path` is not just for shapes. It is one of the most powerful animation tools in CSS.

#### The inset shape

`clip-path: inset(top right bottom left)` defines a rectangular clipping region. Each value "eats" into the element from that side.

```css
/* Fully hidden from right */
.hidden {
  clip-path: inset(0 100% 0 0);
}

/* Fully visible */
.visible {
  clip-path: inset(0 0 0 0);
}

/* Reveal from left to right */
.overlay {
  clip-path: inset(0 100% 0 0);
  transition: clip-path 200ms ease-out;
}
.button:active .overlay {
  clip-path: inset(0 0 0 0);
  transition: clip-path 2s linear;
}
```

#### Tabs with perfect color transitions

Duplicate the tab list. Style the copy as "active" (different background, different text color). Clip the copy so only the active tab is visible. Animate the clip on tab change. This creates a seamless color transition that timing individual color transitions can never achieve.

#### Hold-to-delete pattern

Use `clip-path: inset(0 100% 0 0)` on a colored overlay. On `:active`, transition to `inset(0 0 0 0)` over 2s with linear timing. On release, snap back with 200ms ease-out. Add `scale(0.97)` on the button for press feedback.

#### Image reveals on scroll

Start with `clip-path: inset(0 0 100% 0)` (hidden from bottom). Animate to `inset(0 0 0 0)` when the element enters the viewport. Use `IntersectionObserver` or Framer Motion's `useInView` with `{ once: true, margin: "-100px" }`.

#### Comparison sliders

Overlay two images. Clip the top one with `clip-path: inset(0 50% 0 0)`. Adjust the right inset value based on drag position. No extra DOM elements needed, fully hardware-accelerated.

### Gesture and Drag Interactions

#### Momentum-based dismissal

Don't require dragging past a threshold. Calculate velocity: `Math.abs(dragDistance) / elapsedTime`. If velocity exceeds ~0.11, dismiss regardless of distance. A quick flick should be enough.

```js
const timeTaken = new Date().getTime() - dragStartTime.current.getTime();
const velocity = Math.abs(swipeAmount) / timeTaken;

if (Math.abs(swipeAmount) >= SWIPE_THRESHOLD || velocity > 0.11) {
  dismiss();
}
```

#### Damping at boundaries

When a user drags past the natural boundary (e.g., dragging a drawer up when already at top), apply damping. The more they drag, the less the element moves. Things in real life don't suddenly stop; they slow down first.

#### Pointer capture for drag

Once dragging starts, set the element to capture all pointer events. This ensures dragging continues even if the pointer leaves the element bounds.

#### Multi-touch protection

Ignore additional touch points after the initial drag begins. Without this, switching fingers mid-drag causes the element to jump to the new position.

```js
function onPress() {
  if (isDragging) return;
  // Start drag...
}
```

#### Friction instead of hard stops

Instead of preventing upward drag entirely, allow it with increasing friction. It feels more natural than hitting an invisible wall.

### Debugging Animations

#### Slow motion testing

Play animations at reduced speed to spot issues invisible at full speed. Temporarily increase duration to 2-5x normal, or use browser DevTools animation inspector to slow playback.

Things to look for in slow motion:

- Do colors transition smoothly, or do you see two distinct states overlapping?
- Does the easing feel right, or does it start/stop abruptly?
- Is the transform-origin correct, or does the element scale from the wrong point?
- Are multiple animated properties (opacity, transform, color) in sync?

#### Frame-by-frame inspection

Step through animations frame by frame in Chrome DevTools (Animations panel). This reveals timing issues between coordinated properties that you cannot see at full speed.

#### Test on real devices

For touch interactions (drawers, swipe gestures), test on physical devices. Connect your phone via USB, visit your local dev server by IP address, and use Safari's remote devtools. The Xcode Simulator is an alternative but real hardware is better for gesture testing.
