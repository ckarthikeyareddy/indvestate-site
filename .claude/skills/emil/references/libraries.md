# pick and sonner modes - curated libraries, and Sonner in depth

`pick` is explicit-invoke only: match the task (not the library the user named) to the curated list, check `package.json` first, recommend one. `sonner` answers setup, styling, and troubleshooting from section 2 and the API reference.

---

# 1. Pick the right library

### How to use this

1. **Identify the task**, not the library the user named. "I need to show a dropdown" is a UI-primitives task (base-ui), even if they asked about something else.
2. **Check what's already installed.** Look at `package.json` first. If the project already uses a listed library, use it. If it uses a competitor (e.g. react-window instead of Virtuoso), flag the recommendation but don't churn the dependency without being asked.
3. **Recommend one library**, state what it's for in one sentence, and install/wire it up if that's part of the request. Don't present a menu of options when the list has a clear answer.
4. If the task isn't covered by the list, say so explicitly and recommend from your own knowledge — but be clear you've left the curated list.

### The list

#### UI components & primitives

| Task | Library |
| --- | --- |
| Unstyled, accessible UI components (dialogs, popovers, menus, selects…) | [base-ui](https://base-ui.com) |
| Command menus (⌘K palettes) | [cmdk](https://cmdk.paco.me) |
| Toasts / notifications | [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski) |
| One-time password / verification code inputs | [input-otp](https://input-otp.rodz.dev) |
| Customizable GUIs / control panels | [Leva](https://github.com/pmndrs/leva) — [dialkit](https://joshpuckett.me/dialkit) is an alternative |

#### Motion & visuals

| Task | Library |
| --- | --- |
| General-purpose animation (springs, layout animations, enter/exit) | [motion](https://motion.dev) (Framer Motion) |
| Animating numbers (counters, prices, stats) | [NumberFlow](https://number-flow.barvian.me) |
| Animated text components | [torph](https://torph.lochie.me/) |
| 3D globes | [Cobe](https://cobe.vercel.app) |
| Dynamic OG images (HTML/CSS → SVG/PNG) | [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori) |
| Syntax highlighting | [shiki](https://shiki.style) |

Reach for motion when you need springs, layout animations, exit animations, or gesture-driven values. A simple hover or fade doesn't need it — plain CSS transitions are the right tool there.

#### Charts

| Task | Library |
| --- | --- |
| Real-time / streaming charts | [Liveline](https://github.com/benjitaylor/liveline) |
| General charts (static or interactive dashboards) | [recharts](https://recharts.org) |

The split: if data points arrive live and the chart scrolls with time, use Liveline. Everything else is recharts.

#### Interaction & performance

| Task | Library |
| --- | --- |
| Drag and drop | [dnd kit](https://dndkit.com) |
| Virtualization (long lists, large tables) | [Virtuoso](https://virtuoso.dev) |

#### State & styling

| Task | Library |
| --- | --- |
| State management | [zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs) |
| Constructing `className` strings conditionally | [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) |
| Type-safe, variant-driven styling for Tailwind | [cva](https://cva.style) |
| Theme switching / dark mode (no flash on load) | [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) |

The styling split: clsx for ad-hoc conditional classes; cva when a component has real variants (size, intent, state) that deserve a typed API. They compose — cva uses clsx-style inputs internally.

### Common mismatches to catch

- **Toasts built by hand or with a modal library** → Sonner exists for exactly this.
- **A `<div>`-based dropdown/dialog with manual focus handling** → base-ui, which handles accessibility, focus trapping, and dismissal.
- **Animating a number by re-rendering text** → NumberFlow handles digit transitions properly.
- **Rendering a 1,000+ row list directly** → Virtuoso before reaching for pagination hacks.
- **A `useState`-per-component web of props for shared state** → zustand.
- **Template-literal className ternaries three conditions deep** → clsx (or cva if it's variant-shaped).

# 2. Sonner

### Setup

Two pieces, and only two:

1. **One `<Toaster />`, mounted once**, as close to the root as possible (in Next.js: `layout.tsx` — it works inside server components). Never render it per-page or conditionally; a second mounted Toaster duplicates every toast.
2. **`toast()` called from client code** — event handlers, effects, callbacks. It's a plain function, no hook or provider needed, but it does nothing on the server: in a server action, return the result and call `toast()` in the client code that receives it.

```jsx
import { Toaster } from 'sonner'; // once, in layout
import { toast } from 'sonner';   // anywhere client-side
```

### Picking the right call

| You want | Call |
| --- | --- |
| Plain message | `toast('Title')` — add `{ description }` for a second line |
| Success / error / info / warning icon | `toast.success('…')`, `toast.error('…')`, etc. |
| Spinner while you manage state yourself | `toast.loading('…')`, then update it by id |
| Loading → success/error tied to a promise | `toast.promise(promise, { loading, success, error })` — success/error accept functions receiving the resolved value/error |
| Button that does something | `{ action: { label, onClick } }` — closes the toast unless `onClick` calls `event.preventDefault()`; `cancel` is the secondary variant |
| Custom JSX, default toast shell | `toast(<jsx />)` |
| Custom JSX, no styles at all | `toast.custom((t) => <jsx />)` — headless, `t` gives you the id to dismiss |

### Recipes

**Update a toast** — call `toast()` again with the same `id`; only the props you pass change. Switching to `toast.success(…, { id })` changes the type. This is how loading → success flows work without `toast.promise`:

```jsx
const id = toast.loading('Uploading…');
toast.success('Uploaded', { id });
```

**Persist** — `{ duration: Infinity }`. **Dismiss** — `toast.dismiss(id)`, or `toast.dismiss()` for all. **Read active toasts** — `useSonner()` in React, `toast.getActiveToasts()` outside it.

**Links or components in the text** — pass a function for the title or description: `toast(() => <a href="…">View</a>)`.

**Multiple toasters** — give each an `id` and target with `toast('…', { toasterId: 'canvas' })`. Without `toasterId`, every toaster renders the toast.

**Close callbacks** — `onDismiss` fires on close button or swipe; `onAutoClose` fires on timeout. They are separate; there is no single "closed" callback.

### Styling — the escalation ladder

Climb only as far as the change requires; jumping to the top rung too early is fine (it's the recommended end state), lingering in the middle is not.

1. **Defaults** — plus `richColors` on the Toaster for colorful success/error, `invert` to flip against the theme.
2. **Inline tweaks** — `toastOptions={{ style: {…} }}` on the Toaster for all toasts, or `style` per `toast()` call.
3. **Classes on parts** — `toastOptions={{ classNames: { toast, title, description, actionButton, cancelButton, closeButton } }}`. Sonner's injected styles win the cascade, so every class needs `!important` (Tailwind: `!text-red-900`). If you're marking more than a few things important, stop — go headless.
4. **Headless** — `toast.custom()` with your own JSX, keeping Sonner's positioning, stacking, and swipe. The recommended approach for a design-system toast: wrap it in your own `toast()` abstraction. (`unstyled: true` exists as a halfway house, but headless gives more control for the same effort.)

**Icons** — swap defaults per-type with the Toaster's `icons` prop, per-toast with `icon`, remove with `null`.

**Theme** — `theme` defaults to `'light'` and does not track the OS. Pass `theme="system"`, or wire your theme provider: `<Toaster theme={resolvedTheme} />` from `next-themes`.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause → fix |
| --- | --- |
| Toast never appears | No `<Toaster />` mounted, or it unmounted (conditional render, per-page placement). Mount one at the root. If calling from a server action: `toast()` is client-only — call it with the action's result on the client. |
| Same toast appears twice | Two Toasters mounted (layout **and** page) — keep one. Or `toast()` fired in an effect under React StrictMode's dev double-invoke — fire from the event handler instead, or pass a stable `id` so the second call updates rather than duplicates. |
| Tailwind/CSS classes have no effect | Default styles override them. Mark them `!important`, or use `unstyled` / headless (see the ladder above). |
| Toasts render completely unstyled (common in Astro, view transitions) | Sonner's injected stylesheet was lost — import it explicitly in a layout: `import 'sonner/dist/styles.css'`. |
| Unstyled inside Shadow DOM | Styles land in `document.head`, not the shadow root. Copy the style tag whose text includes `[data-sonner-toaster]` into the shadow root. |
| Toast behind a modal/overlay, or clipped | An ancestor creates a stacking context (`transform`, `filter`, `overflow`) or the overlay out-z-indexes the toaster. Move `<Toaster />` to the document root, outside any dialog/portal container. |
| Dark mode ignored | `theme` defaults to `'light'` — set `theme="system"` or pass the resolved theme (see Theme above). |
| Success/error look gray, not green/red | That's the default. Add `richColors` to the Toaster. |
| Toast never closes | `duration: Infinity`, `dismissible: false`, or a `toast.promise` whose promise never settles — the loading toast waits forever. |
| `toast.promise` stuck on loading | It needs a promise (or a function returning one) as its first argument, and the promise must actually resolve/reject. |
| Swipe-to-dismiss goes the wrong way / doesn't work | Directions derive from `position`. Override with `swipeDirections` on the Toaster. |
| Toast shows up in every toaster | Multiple toasters need targeting: give each Toaster an `id` and pass `toasterId` in the `toast()` call. |
| Toasts too close to the screen edge on mobile | `offset` (desktop, default 32px) and `mobileOffset` (<600px, default 16px) — numbers, CSS strings, or per-side objects. |

# 3. Sonner API reference

Exact props, types, and defaults. Options passed to `toast()` override the same options set via the Toaster's `toastOptions`.

### `<Toaster />`

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `theme` | `string` | `'light'` | `'light'`, `'dark'`, or `'system'`. |
| `richColors` | `boolean` | `false` | Makes error and success states more colorful. |
| `expand` | `boolean` | `false` | Toasts expanded by default (otherwise they expand on hover). |
| `visibleToasts` | `number` | `3` | Amount of visible toasts. |
| `id` | `string` | – | Toaster id, targeted by `toast()`'s `toasterId` option. |
| `position` | `string` | `'bottom-right'` | `top-left`, `top-center`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-center`, `bottom-right`. |
| `closeButton` | `boolean` | `false` | Adds a close button to all toasts. |
| `offset` | `string \| number \| object` | `'32px'` | Offset from screen edges. Object form is per-side: `{ bottom: '24px', right: '16px' }`. |
| `mobileOffset` | `string \| number \| object` | `'16px'` | Offset when screen width < 600px. |
| `swipeDirections` | `array` | based on position | Allowed swipe-to-dismiss directions. |
| `dir` | `string` | `'ltr'` | Text directionality. |
| `hotkey` | `string` | `⌥/alt + T` | Keyboard shortcut that focuses the toaster area. |
| `invert` | `boolean` | `false` | Dark toasts in light mode and vice versa. |
| `toastOptions` | `object` | – | Default options applied to every toast (any `toast()` option below). |
| `gap` | `number` | `14` | Gap between toasts when expanded. |
| `icons` | `object` | – | Replace default icons: `{ success, info, warning, error, loading }`; `null` removes one. |

### `toast()` options

`toast(message, options)` — message is a string, JSX, or a function returning JSX. Returns the toast's id.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `description` | `ReactNode` | – | Renders underneath the title; also accepts a function returning JSX. |
| `closeButton` | `boolean` | `false` | Adds a close button. |
| `invert` | `boolean` | `false` | Dark toast in light mode and vice versa. |
| `duration` | `number` | `4000` | Milliseconds before auto-close. `Infinity` persists the toast. |
| `position` | `string` | `'bottom-right'` | Position of this toast. |
| `dismissible` | `boolean` | `true` | If `false`, the user cannot dismiss the toast. |
| `icon` | `ReactNode` | – | Icon in front of the text; `null` removes the default. |
| `action` | `ReactNode \| { label, onClick }` | – | Primary button; clicking closes the toast unless `onClick` calls `event.preventDefault()`. |
| `cancel` | `ReactNode \| { label, onClick }` | – | Secondary button; clicking closes the toast. |
| `actionButtonStyle` | `object` | `{}` | Styles for the action button. |
| `cancelButtonStyle` | `object` | `{}` | Styles for the cancel button. |
| `id` | `string` | – | Custom id; calling `toast()` again with the same id updates the existing toast. |
| `testId` | `string` | – | Rendered as `data-testid` for e2e tests. |
| `toasterId` | `string` | – | Id of the toaster to render this toast in. |
| `style` | `object` | – | Inline styles for the toast. |
| `classNames` | `object` | – | Classes per part: `{ toast, title, description, actionButton, cancelButton, closeButton }`. Needs `!important` unless `unstyled`. |
| `unstyled` | `boolean` | `false` | Removes all default styles. |
| `onDismiss` | `(toast) => void` | – | Fires when the close button is clicked or the toast is swiped away. |
| `onAutoClose` | `(toast) => void` | – | Fires when the toast closes automatically after `duration`. |
| `containerAriaLabel` | `string` | `'Notifications'` | ARIA label for the toast container. |

### Functions

| Function | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `toast(message, opts?)` | Render a toast; returns its id. |
| `toast.success / .error / .info / .warning(message, opts?)` | Typed toast with matching icon. |
| `toast.loading(message, opts?)` | Toast with a spinner; update it by id. |
| `toast.promise(promise, { loading, success, error })` | Loading toast that resolves with the promise; `success`/`error` accept strings, JSX, functions of the result, or objects of toast options. |
| `toast.custom((t) => jsx, opts?)` | Headless toast — your JSX, Sonner's behavior. |
| `toast.dismiss(id?)` | Dismiss one toast, or all when called without an id. |
| `toast.getActiveToasts()` | All active toasts, usable outside React. |
| `useSonner()` | React hook returning `{ toasts }`. |
